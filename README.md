matlab-bench
============

This is a small collection of utilities for exploring and learning about the behavior of the Matlab IDE and runtime.

Each of the tools is in its own subdirectory from which it can be run.

## Caveats

The results of these tools are inherently system-dependent. Be careful about extrapolating what you learn from them.

These tools are not intended for use in production code.
